[b]TechTalk "Modern full-stack JavaScript web app solution structure: Yo, Gulp, NPM and Bower‚Äù[/b]

Example of modern full-stack JavaScript web app using Yo, Gulp, NPM and Bower tools for the following development tasks:
- Application template scaffolding;
- Dependencies manangement;
- Build system:
  - Code compilation and validation; application start-up and testing;
  - Code metrics reports and documentation generation;
  - Application distribution package generation.


- Application template scaffolding 
yo (http://yeoman.io/) scaffolds out a new application, writing your Grunt configuration and pulling in relevant Grunt tasks and Bower dependencies that you might need for your build.

- Dependencies manangement;
The Package Manager is used for dependency management, so that you no longer have to manually download and manage your scripts. Bower (http://bower.io/) and npm (https://www.npmjs.org/) are two popular options.

- Build system:
The Build System is used to build, preview and test your project. Grunt (http://gruntjs.com/) and Gulp (http://gulpjs.com/) are two popular options.

  - Code compilation and validation; application start-up and testing;
  - Code metrics reports and documentation generation;
  - Application distribution package generation.
